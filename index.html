<h1> I am currently enrolled as a sophomore in the School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Rochester pursuing an undergraduate degree. I am double majoring in Data Science and Business in the Analytics track. I am an aspiring data scientist who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in engineering, statistics, and machine learning.</h1>
